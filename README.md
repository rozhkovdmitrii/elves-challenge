This is an implementation of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1)

It provides the CalibrationDoc abstraction, which is designed to retrieve a calibration value from a document consisting of lines of text. Each of them initially contains a certain calibration value

Getting the calibration value could be performed by calling `get_line_calibration_v2` method

## Further improvements

The next improvement is to implement pattern construction at compile time
